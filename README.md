# Objective and Method
•Purpose: understand what contributes to the success of certain players or teams
•Approach: utilize NBA play-by-play data to provide analytics
•Offer insights into optimal strategies for leveraging star player dynamics by analyzing their +/- (Plus/minus)
•Determine if the star player has improved the performance of his teammates by comparing changes in their shooting percentage
## Method Explanation
| **For Example** | **Both Stars** | **Star A only** | **Star B only** | **No star** | **Total** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| +/- per min | 6 | 2 | 3 | -0.5 |  |
| Star playing time |  | 36 | 24 |  |  |
| “Together” min | 24 | 12 | 0 |  |  |
| **“Together” **
**(+/-per min) * min** | **6*24** | **2*12** | **0** | **-0.5*12** | **162** |
| “Separate” min | 12 | 24 | 12 | 0 |  |
| **“Separate” **
**(+/-per min) * min** | **6*12** | **2*24** | **3*12** | **0** | **156** |

- +/- per min: Difference of scored points against the other team in that deployment
- “Together”: Prioritize deploying both players simultaneously  (The star player who plays longer will have time that he’s the only star playing)
- “Separate”: Prioritize deploying star players separately (Star players usually play more than 48 min per game, so there’ll be time for them to play together)
- Calculate and compare the total +/- per game to decide whether the team should deploy the star players together or separately
## How does a team best use a “power partnership”?

- Red docs: Separating star players' court time, allowing them to lead the team at different intervals
- For example: James Harden & Chris Paul, LeBron James & Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo & Khris Middleton, etc.
- Blue docs: a pair ofstar players is on the court simultaneously can produce better results
- For example: Russell Westbrook & Paul George, Nikola Jokic & Jamal Murray, Donovan Mitchell & Rudy Gobert, etc.
- Conclusion: Usually, a combination of frontcourt and guard players often performs better when playing together on the basketball court primarily stems from the complementary skills and tactical versatility required in basketball.

Do great players make their teammates better?

•The change in the average points per attempt of the star player's teammates when he is on the court.
•Blue docs: the star player can improve his teammates' shooting performance
•For example: James Harden (in 2017-18, 2018-19 season), Russell Westbrook, Stephen Curry, Luka Doncic, etc.
•Red docs: When this star player on the field, his teammates shoot worse
•For example: Joel Embiid, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Rudy Gobert, Anthony Davis, etc.
•Conclusion: most star players make their teammates perform better

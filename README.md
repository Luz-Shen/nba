## Objective and Method
- Purpose: understand what contributes to the success of certain players or teams
- Approach: utilize NBA play-by-play data to provide analytics
- Offer insights into optimal strategies for leveraging star player dynamics by analyzing their +/ (Plus/minus)
- Determine if the star player has improved the performance of his teammates by comparing changes in their shooting percentages

## Method Explanation
| **For Example** | **Both Stars** | **Star A only** | **Star B only** | **No star** | **Total** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| +/- per min | 6 | 2 | 3 | -0.5 |  |
| Star playing time |  | 36 | 24 |  |  |
| “Together” min | 24 | 12 | 0 |  |  |
| **“Together” **
**(+/-per min) * min** | **6*24** | **2*12** | **0** | **-0.5*12** | **162** |
| “Separate” min | 12 | 24 | 12 | 0 |  |
| **“Separate” **
**(+/-per min) * min** | **6*12** | **2*24** | **3*12** | **0** | **156** |

- +/- per min: Difference of scored points against the other team in that deployment
- “Together”: Prioritize deploying both players simultaneously (The star player who plays longer will have time that he’s the only star playing)
- “Separate”: Prioritize deploying star players separately (Star players usually play more than 48 min per game, so there’ll be time for them to play together)
- Calculate and compare the total +/- per game to decide whether the team should deploy the star players together or separately

## How does a team best use a “power partnership”?

- Red docs: Separating star players' court time, allowing them to lead the team at different intervals
- For example: James Harden & Chris Paul, LeBron James & Anthony Davis, 	Giannis 			Antetokounmpo & Khris Middleton, etc.
- Blue docs: a pair ofstar players is on the court simultaneously can produce better results
- For example: Russell Westbrook & Paul George, Nikola Jokic & Jamal 		Murray, 	Donovan Mitchell & Rudy Gobert, etc.
- Conclusion: Usually, a combination of frontcourt and guard players often performs better when playing together on the basketball court primarily stems from the complementary skills and tactical versatility required in basketball.

## Do great players make their teammates better?

- The change in the average points per attempt of the star player's teammates when he is on the court.
- Blue docs: the star player can improve his teammates' shooting performance
- For example: James Harden (in 2017-18, 2018-19 season), Russell Westbrook, Stephen Curry, Luka 		Doncic, etc.
- Red docs: When this star player on the field, his teammates shoot worse
- For example: Joel Embiid, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Rudy Gobert, Anthony Davis, etc.
- Conclusion: most star players make their teammates perform better
